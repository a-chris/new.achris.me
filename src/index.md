<b>Ehi, welcome to my website! I'm Christian, a software developer from Italy.</b>

I'm a passioante software developer and I explore new ways to solve problems. I had the opportunity work on several aspect of software development: monolith and microservices, data-intensive applications, millions of background jobs, CI/CD solutions and static website generation (like this one!). My reliability makes me a point of reference for both teams and business as I am capable of collaborating with others but also solving problems autonomously.

Feel free to contact me for your next-big-thing project or just small collaborations.

  ðŸ’¡ I believe that technology is meant to make people's lives easier, and as developers, it's our responsibility to achieve this goal!
