description: Best Visual Studio Code extensions and settings to work with Ruby and Ruby on Rails and bring several RubyMine features.
---

I've been using Ruby for three years and Visual Studio Code has been my preferred IDE since day one. Coming from a Java background, I initially tried using RubyMine: it had several feature I was missing on VS Code but it was resource-expensive and I didn't like the UI (I know it has improved recently).

**This led me to seek out the best VS Code extentions and settings to work with Ruby (and Ruby on Rails) to brings some of the RubyMine features I was missing.**

I am currently using these extensions on both MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora) but I'm confident that everything should work fine on Windows as well.

Here are the extensions that save me a lot of time every day and make programming with Ruby ~~less painful~~ a pleasure! I will also share my JSON settings so that you can have everything setup and running in a few minutes üöÄ

## Copy Ruby Reference

First we go with [Copy Ruby Reference](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mickey.code-copy-ruby-ref), a time saver extension, which simplifies copying the full name of a Ruby class. Just right-click and select "copy Ruby reference" to copy class names including all their modules.

So you will get `Strategies::Advertisement::Fetchers::Unnotified` in your clipboard, ready to be pasted and used in your code.

## Solargraph

![Solargraph](/images/blog/vscode/solargraph.webp)

Solargraph is an essential extension for working with Ruby, as it allows VS Code to understand your code and provide helpful features like intellisense, code completion, and inline documentation.

If you have already installed and configured Solargraph then you can jump to the tip section, otherwise follow the steps to install it.

### Installing Solargraph

[Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph) requires its Ruby gem to work properly, you can install it with:

```
gem install solargraph
```

and install the Ruby Solargraph extension for Visual Studio Code.

Then, find the gem's location:

```
which solargraph
```

and copy the result, that in my case is `/home/chri/.rbenv/shims/solargraph` because I'm using **rbenv** (it is not important at the moment).

Open the **VS Code JSON Settings** and paste the following lines:
```
"solargraph.commandPath": "YOUR_GEM_PATH",
"solargraph.formatting": true
```

where `commandPath` is the path you obtain by running `which solargraph`.

### Solargraph tips

In previous versions of Solargraph I used to run `solargraph bundle` to analyze the project dependencies, download all the gems documentations and obtain intellisense and code suggestions. Sadly, this command has been deprecated with Solargraph 0.50.0.

Luckily we can obtain similar results by using the `yard` gem.

**Installing yard**

Install the yard gem with
```bash
  gem install yard
```

now, download the gems documentation and RBS files with
```ruby
  yard gems
  yard config --gem-install-yri
```

These two lines ensure your project's dependencies are analyzed, the gems are documented, and get a chance to have intellisense.

## Ruby LSP

![RubyLSP](/images/blog/vscode/ruby_lsp.webp)

[Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp) is the new suggested extension to work with Ruby by the [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/ruby). I must admit I was full of hope when I first went to install it but it was a bit delusional. Don't get me wrong, it must be hard to work with a magic language like Ruby but this extension is not ready to fully replace Solargraph.

Pro:
- Easy to install. It does it all by itself, no need to run `gem install solargraph` or whatever.
- It also replaces **rubocop** as formatter if well configured
- It can use **rbenv** by default with `"rubyLsp.rubyVersionManager": "rbenv"`
- Faster than the old Ruby extension
- Debugging and breakpoints out of the box, to be honest I did not test this feature since I'm a heady **byebug** user but it could be really appreciated if you come from RubyMine

Cons:
- I do not see any suggestion while writing code, like at all
- The `Go to definition` also, `cmd+click`, sometimes do not work
- Every time you change the **Gemfile.lock** a popup appears on the bottom-right of VS Code to update the gems/documentation/whatever_it_is_doing, it could be annoying if you have many gems and it slow down your machine

So, it has its pros and is going to the right direction, this will probably be the future of Ruby on VS Code but at the moment it does not offer any life-changing feature while having some annoying downturns. It's up to you whether to use it or not, give it a chance and let me know what you think.

## Ruby Interpolation Autocomplete

![RubyInterpolationAutocomplete](/images/blog/vscode/ruby_int_compl.webp)

[Ruby Interpolation Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ghbozz.hashtag) is a small but well-appreciated extention that automatically add the `#{}` when you first type `#` inside a Ruby string.

This only work for strings with double apex `"` or backtick ```.

<div style="border-radius:6px;padding:1em;background-color:bisque;display:flex;margin:3em 0;">

## Rails Schema

Still wasting your time moving to the `schema.rb` every time you need to know which columns belong to a table? Please stop!

![RailsSchema](/images/blog/vscode/rails_schema.png)

[Rails Schema](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tavo.rails-schema) is a handy extension to keep a view of the database in the VS Code sidebar, it takes no time for configuration, just install it and you are ready to go.

![RailsSchemaExample](/images/blog/vscode/rails_schema_example.png)

## Rails DB Schema

Another great addition to work with Ruby on Rails, [Rails DB Schema](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aki77.rails-db-schema) offers intellisense for database columns and a quick navigation to the selected table in the `schema.rb` file.

## ColorTabs

![ColorTabs](/images/blog/vscode/color_tabs.webp)

[ColorTabs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=orepor.color-tabs-vscode-ext) is the gem that I use to quickly recognize test files because it gives a different color to the current open tab of Visual Studio Code based on a series of regular expressions set by the user. In this case, my project uses RSpec for the test suite and I want the tabs to become green when a test is open in Visual Studio Code. In case you do not know, RSpec test files have the **_spec** suffix at the end of the name, that's the way I'm using to recognize them.

`my_file.rb` => becomes => `my_file_spec.rb`

Here is my configuration:

```
"colorTabs.ignoreCase": true,
"colorTabs.titleBackground": true,
"colorTabs.titleLabel": true,
"colorTabs.config": [
  {
    "regex": ".*spec.*",
    "color": "#007f00"
  }
]
```

you can replace `".*spec.*"` with the prefix used by your test suite. It is also possible to declare multiple patterns by adding multiple JSON objects with these fields:

```
{
  "regex": "...",
  "color": "..."
}
```

## Switch to test

![Switch to test](/images/blog/vscode/switch_to_test.webp)

[Switch to test](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eskimoblood.create-test) is a useful extension that allows you to quickly create a test file and switch between a file and its corresponding test file. For example, if your source file is located at `app/services/awesome/service/file.rb`, your test file will be created at `spec/services/awesome/service/file_test.rb`.

Although this extension was not specifically developed for Ruby, but rather for Javascript and Typescript, it works well with Ruby by adjusting a few settings.

Here's my configuration for using it with Ruby and RSpec:

```
"createTest.testFolder": "spec",
"createTest.testFileExtension": "_spec.rb",
"createTest.srcFileExtension": " .rb",
"createTest.srcFolder": "app",
"createTest.testFileTemplate": [
  "require 'rails_helper'",
  "",
  "RSpec.describe CLASS_NAME do",
  "",
  "end"
],
```

the `testFileTemplate` takes an array of elements because each element is a newline. The `srcFolder` is used to ignore the `app` folder of the Ruby on Rails project, if we omit this setting then the extension will create the test file in `app/spec/services/awesome/service/file_test.rb` that would be wrong.

Now this extension gives you two commands you can run:
- `Create test` that will instantly create the test, using the given template, for the file that is open at the moment or open the test file if it already exists (and is located in the right path)
- `Go to Test` that will only try to open the test file related or display an error if the test file does not exist

You can basically run `Create test` all the time and forget about the other command. That's my workflow.
Super handy, I'm loving this extension because now I can create the test with one click, no more time wasted to create nested folders for my file or copy-paste the RSpec boilerplate!

## Bust a gem
![Bust a gem](/images/blog/vscode/bust_a_gem.webp)

Using RubyMine we can just click on a gem inside your project to see its source code and what it is doing under the hood, with VS Code this is not possible anymore.. wait! We have **Bust a gem**!

Bust a gem is an awesome extension that allows us to step into the source code of a gem by clicking on the method we are interested in, as we usually do to see the definition of our methods.

It requires a bit of configuration to work as expected, you can follow the official documentation to set it up but let me summarize it for you:

1. Install the extension
2. Install the `ripper-tags` gem with

```
gem install ripper-tags
```

3. Open your Ruby project in Visual Studio Code and run the command `Bust-A-gem: Rebuild Tags`
4. Let it run, it may take a few minutes if your project is really big
5. The command will create a `TAGS` file into the root of your project, I suggest you to add this file into the `.gitignore` to avoid pushing it to the online repository, your colleagues will appreciate it.
6. Profit!üí∏üí∏üí∏

Now you can see the source code of a method by looking for its definition or you can open the full source code of an installed gem by running the `Bust-A-Gem: Open Gem...` command in Visual Studio Code.

## Endwise

![Endwise](/images/blog/vscode/endwise.png)

[Endwise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kaiwood.endwise) is a very handy extention that automatically adds `end` when required, for example if you type a new line after declaring a method or a block.
It requires zero configurations, just install it and it will works for Ruby files.

## Tailwind CSS

TailwindCSS is undeniably the trendsetter in the world of CSS frameworks right now and after working with it I can understand why people love it so much.

The go-to extension for working with it is [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) which I recommend you to install because it improves the development workflow by providing autocompletion and hover information.

Now, to make it work with `.erb` files and moreover, to enable Tailwind intellisense and autocompletion with Rails `content_tag`, just paste these lines into your VS Code Settings!

```json
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascript",
    "html": "html",
    "erb": "html"
  },
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "class: \"|'([^\"|']*)"
  ],
```

and woil√†, Tailwind classes autocompetion right in to your Rails views.

## Rails Open Partials

![Rails Open Partials](/images/blog/vscode/rails_open_partials.webp)

As you can guess Rails Open Partials is a tiny extension that recognizes Rails view partials and opens them when you click on their name.
For example, clicking on the following code
```ruby
render partial: 'contents/report_item'
```
will open the `_report_item.html.erb` file.

This extension requires no configuration however I noticed it conflicts with Solargraph sometimes so it leads to the definition of a method instead of the partial file. Anyway, I put it on the list because you may find it useful, depending on your project setup.

# VS Code Settings

## Sticky Scroll

This is not a VS Code extension but a brand new feature of the editor. It makes the classname and method name to become sticky (stay on top) even while scrolling down, so we always know which method we are reading.

![StickyScroll](/images/blog/vscode/sticky_scroll.webp)

you can enable it by editing your JSON configuration with the following line:

```json
"editor.stickyScroll.enabled": true
```

or looking for "sticky" in the UI Settings.

## Emmet autocomplete

Did you know that you can have Emmet autocomplete in `erb` files?
No? Me too! It took me 3 years to find out. Now I'm regretting all the time I wasted so much time manually writingthe css elements and classes..

Emmet declares dynamic snippets so that you can just write `.grid` and it will replaced by `<div class="grid"></div>`.
But this happens only for HTML files, unless you tell Emmet that you want it to work with ERB too!

Here's the line you should add to the JSON settings to make Emmet works with ERB files (or whatever format you are using)

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": { "erb": "html", "ruby": "html" }
```

Emmet comes with VS Code, no need to install any particular extension.

That's all at the moment üôÇ
I periodically update this post when I discover new extentions or useful settings, for example the Sticky Scroll one has been added only in mid-2023!

I hope you guys enjoyed this post, if you have any extension or setting fo suggest just reach out to me on Twitter or Mastodon I will be happy to give you the credits ü•∞
