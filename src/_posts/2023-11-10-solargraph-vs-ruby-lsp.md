description: A summary of the differences between Solargraph and Ruby LSP with pros and cons, the state of Ruby Language Servers and which one you should use.
---

As a Ruby and Ruby on Rails enthusiast, I've been using Visual Studio Code as main IDE for the past three years. During this time, my go-to Ruby language server has been Solargraph, which has served me well. However, the winds of curiosity recently led me to explore Ruby LSP, the newcomer in the Ruby development scene and I though to write this post to share my recent experience.

### What is a Language Server Protocol?
Before we dive into the Solargraph vs. Ruby LSP debate, it's crucial to grasp the concept of **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**. LSP is a standardized protocol for facilitating communication between an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a language server, enhancing the development experience.
In simple terms, LSP acts as a bridge between your code and your IDE. It's like having a coding buddy that helps with autocompletion, error checking, and code formatting, making your development journey smoother.

### A Bit of History
Solargraph is a veteran in the Ruby world, as it has been released in March 2017. For years, it's been the go-to choice for Ruby developers, including myself. Powered by YARD documentation, it became the de-facto standard, offering hints and syntax suggestions within Visual Studio Code.

Ruby LSP is the newcomer, it is developed by Shopify, a major player in the Ruby community and Ruby LSP aims to provide a more modern and scalable solution in the long run. It's the shiny new toy in the Ruby development playground, backed by the expertise of a reputable company.

## Differences between Solargraph and Ruby LSP
Now that we've covered the basics, let's dive into the differences between Solargraph and Ruby LSP. The two language servers are similar in many ways, but they differ in a few key areas, including performance, installation process and extensibility.

### Solargraph: YARD-ing the Way

Solargraph relies on YARD documentation from your codebase and external gems. It's been my loyal companion, although not always perfect, especially when dealing with the magic of Ruby on Rails. Performance-wise, it's been a smooth ride on both Mac and Linux, with a few tricks up its sleeve to speed things up.

For the curious minds, I've shared performance-enhancing and configuration tips in another tutorial
[Best Visual Studio Code extensions and settings for Ruby and Rails](/posts/2023/11/06/setup-ruby-vscode/)

The installation process involves a series of steps to have everything set up correctly:
1. install the solargraph VSCode extension
2. install the solargraph and yard gems
3. run "solargraph download-core"
4. run "yard gems" (optional but recommended)

Note that there have been a few changes in the Solargraph CLI commands in the latest releases and the official documentation is not at its best.

#### It's deprecated, is it dead?
In 2023 Solargraph has been deprecated in favor of Ruby LSP. It's not dead, but it is largely deprecated due to funding and due to the mantainer having very little time to work on it. However it remains a valid and well working solution for projects not using RBS.

There have been an interesting thread on Mastodon if you want to know more about the current state of Solargraph and Ruby LSP: [link](https://ruby.social/@achris/111551466092993796)

### Ruby LSP: The RBS Revolution

On the other hand, Ruby LSP takes a different route, making use of RBS for hints and syntax suggestions. RBS proves to be a more accurate and comprehensive type system compared to YARD but it is . Ruby LSP is designed to be more extendible and customizable, offering the possibility to createthird party extensions. to make it work with RSpec [ruby-lsp-rspec](https://github.com/st0012/ruby-lsp-rspec) and [ruby-lsp-rails](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp-rails) for Rails syntax suggestions.

Performance-wise, it used to run `bundle install` with an annoying loading message that made my computer slow everytime the Gemfile was changed. Good news, it seems to be a thing of the past, at least in my recent experience.

One thing I noticed is that Ruby LSP is still missing the `Go to definition` feature that is super-useful while navigating a codebase, in particular with Ruby.

### Choosing Your Coding Companion

<figcaption align = "center">(just joking, the Ruby community is one of the best ‚ô•Ô∏è)</figcaption>

If you're working with project that doesn't provide RBS, Solargraph is still your go-to companion. On the flip side, if your project provides RBS, go for Ruby LSP. Its accuracy and comprehensiveness make it a delight for such setups.

**Hold on, there is more. I suggest you to install both of them!**

Since they work in different ways, they should not conflict and you can benefit from the best of both at the same time: Solargraph for YARD and Ruby LSP for RBS, while having RSpec integration in VSCode and `Go to definition` at the same time.

### What About the Future?
The future looks bright for Ruby LSP, with the backing of Shopify and the community's enthusiasm. It's still in its early stages, but it's gaining popularity, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.

### The Verdict
Solargraph and Ruby LSP are both great language servers, and I can't pick a clear winner. Solargraph is still a reliable choice for projects that don't use RBS, while Ruby LSP is the go-to choice for projects that provide RBS.

In conclusion, I'm excited about the evolution of Ruby development tools, especially with Shopify's dedication to the Ruby ecosystem and the recent Rails, Hotwire and Turbo updates. The future looks promising, and I anticipate seeing Ruby LSP become the new standard for Ruby Language Servers.

I'm also aware of [Fuzzy Ruby Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Blinknlights.fuzzy-ruby-server), which provides useful features like references, renaming, jump to the definitions for methods and variables. Let me know if you have tried it and if I should mention it in this comparison üòé
